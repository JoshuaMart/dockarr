# Installation

## Requirements

- A Linux host (VPS or home server) with [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  and the Docker Compose plugin.
- `git` and `make`.
- Python 3.9+ with the `venv` module (on Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install python3-venv`)
  (`make install` builds an isolated virtualenv to run the bootstrap).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaMart/dockarr.git
cd dockarr
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env (by default only DOCKARR_DOMAIN and CADDY_EMAIL), then:
make install
```

`make install` then:

1. Creates the media folder tree under `data/`.
2. Starts every service in the background (`make up`).
3. Runs the **bootstrap** (`make bootstrap`), which provisions and wires every
   service for you. See [Configuration](configuration.md) for the details.

(If you skip the `cp` step, the first `make install` just creates `.env` and
stops so you can edit it; re-run `make install` afterwards.)

## First-run prompts

The first bootstrap is interactive and asks a few questions (answers are stored
and never asked again):

| Prompt | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| **Language / Langue** | UI language applied to every service: English or Français. |
| **Service username** | A shared username for all services (blank = random). |
| **Password mode** | One shared random password, or a different one per service. |
| **Kavita** | Keep the books/comics/manga server, or stop it. A disabled Kavita stays stopped across `make up` and `make update` (the choice is remembered automatically). |
| **VPN (Gluetun)** | Route qBittorrent through a WireGuard VPN. If enabled, you're asked for the provider and WireGuard credentials. See [VPN](vpn.md). |
| **Profilarr FR** | Optionally wipe the Profilarr database, clone a curated French one and push a quality profile to Radarr/Sonarr. |

On a non-interactive run (no TTY) the safe defaults are used: English, a random
username, a per-service password, Kavita enabled, VPN disabled, Profilarr FR
disabled.

## Credentials

Bootstrap generates the credentials and stores them in `secrets/credentials.json`
(gitignored, `chmod 600`). Print them anytime:

```bash
make creds
```

## Configure `.env`

!!! tip "What to edit by default"
    The defaults work as-is for a local install. To expose the stack on your own
    domain with HTTPS, the only two variables you need to set are
    **`DOCKARR_DOMAIN`** and **`CADDY_EMAIL`**. Everything else can stay at its
    default value.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | User/group that own config & media. Run `id` to find yours. |
| `TZ` | Timezone, e.g. `Europe/Paris`. |
| `DOCKARR_CONFIG` | Where service config is stored (default `./config`). |
| `DOCKARR_DATA` | Shared downloads + media tree (default `./data`). |
| `DOCKARR_DOMAIN` | Base domain for the reverse proxy. |
| `CADDY_EMAIL` | Email for Let's Encrypt certificates. |
| `KAVITA_PORT` | Host port for Kavita (use `5001` on macOS, where AirPlay grabs `:5000`). |
| `VPN_*` / `WIREGUARD_*` | VPN credentials, used only when the VPN is enabled (see [VPN](vpn.md)). |

!!! note "`COMPOSE_PROFILES` / `COMPOSE_FILE`"
    The bootstrap manages these two variables for you to match your `make
    install` answers (Kavita on/off, VPN on/off). The on/off choice is the
    install prompt, not this file — don't edit them by hand.

!!! tip "Hardlinks"
    Keep downloads and media under the **same** `DOCKARR_DATA` tree
    (`/data/torrents` and `/data/media`). This lets Radarr/Sonarr move files
    by hardlink instead of copying: instant and space-free.

!!! note "File ownership (`PUID` / `PGID`)"
    The services run as the `PUID:PGID` set in `.env` (default `1000:1000`). On
    Linux, `make install` aligns the ownership of `DOCKARR_DATA` and
    `DOCKARR_CONFIG` to match, so the containers can write to them. If you
    created the folders as another user (e.g. `root`) and hit a *"not writable
    by user 'abc'"* error, fix it with:
    ```bash
    make fix-perms
    # or manually:
    sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./data ./config
    ```
    On macOS this step is skipped — Docker Desktop virtualises bind-mount
    ownership, so it never applies.

## Daily commands

```bash
make up        # start everything
make down      # stop everything
make ps        # status
make logs      # tail all logs  (make logs s=radarr for one service)
make creds     # print stored service credentials
make update    # git pull + docker compose pull + up -d
make reset     # wipe config + secrets for a clean reinstall (keeps media)
```

Re-provision a single service with `make bootstrap m=<service>` (e.g.
`make bootstrap m=radarr`); the bootstrap is idempotent and skips anything
already configured.

## Access

Direct access by port (e.g. `http://SERVER_IP:7878` for Radarr) works out of
the box. For nice HTTPS URLs (`radarr.yourdomain`) point a wildcard DNS record
at the host and set `DOCKARR_DOMAIN`; see [Configuration](configuration.md).
